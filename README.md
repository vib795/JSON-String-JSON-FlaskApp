## Overview
The Flask JSON String Converter is a web application built using the Flask framework. It allows users to convert strings to formatted JSON objects and reverse-convert JSON objects into specially escaped JSON strings via a simple web interface.

## Requirements

- Flask

## Installation
To run the application, ensure Python and Flask are installed on your system. If Python is not installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To install Flask, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application
1. Clone or download the application source code.

2. Navigate to the application directory.

3. Start the Flask server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    This will run the web server on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default.

4. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to use the application.

## Features
- Web interface to input a string and receive a formatted JSON object.
- Convert and display specially escaped JSON strings.
- Simple and user-friendly GUI.

## Creating an Executable File
For distributing this application as a standalone executable, refer to the documentation of tools like PyInstaller. However, it's more common to deploy Flask applications on web servers.

## Deployment
To deploy the Flask app on a web server, you can use WSGI servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI. For more details, refer to Flask's deployment documentation: [Flask Deployment Options](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/deploying/).
